# Grey-Box Modelling of Dynamic Range Compression

Github repo accompanying the [2022 DAFx Paper 'GREY-BOX MODELLING OF DYNAMIC RANGE COMPRESSION'](https://dafx2020.mdw.ac.at/proceedings/papers/DAFx20in22_paper_35.pdf) by Alec Wright and Vesa Välimäki

The paper fits a lightweight interpretable compressor model to data. The method is not specific to any specific analog compressor, but it was demonstrated on the LA-2A levelling compressor.
To train the model for yourself, you can [download the dataset used in the paper here](https://zenodo.org/record/3824876#.YyMaiOxBzUI)

The default settings used in this repo expect the 'SignalTrain' folder downloaded from the above link to be placed in this directory.
